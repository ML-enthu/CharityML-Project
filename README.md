# CharityML-Project
This project is related to data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization)
identify people most likely to donate to their cause. Evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, optimize the model selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
